# Introduction

## Intuition of Bayesian Statistics

Statistics describes the world in probality distributions. 

Collect data to learn about the distributions: $\hat\theta$

Reverse engineering of parameters producing the data.

How do we deal with uncertainty?

A Bayesian:

- Sets a probabilty distribution on all $\theta$.
- Updates his beliefs with data.

## Set a prior: $P(\theta)$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_data <- data_frame(theta = seq(0, 1, by = .001),
                        prior = dbeta(theta, 4, 4),
                        likelihood = theta^15 * (1-theta)^5,
                        posterior  = dbeta(theta, 18, 8))
settings <- function(gg_obj){
  gg_obj + geom_line() + 
  theme(axis.text.y  = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  ylab("")
}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(theta, prior)) %>% settings()
```

## Get the likelihood function: $P(D|\theta)$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(theta, likelihood)) %>% settings()
```

## Update prior to posterior with likelihood: $P(\theta|D)$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot_data %>% select(-likelihood) %>% 
  gather(key = distribution, value = dens, -theta) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(theta, dens, col = distribution)) %>% settings()
```

Likelihood not in this plot, on different scale (why?).

## Bayesian data analysis

The essence of BDA is **credibility (re)allocation**.

We have an a priori idea about $\theta$:
  
- expert opinion
- previous research
- educated guess

Data provides evidence of the parameter value.

The posterior is a compromise between prior and likelihood. It reflects the current knowledge.

## Bayesian vs frequentist

- Frequentist only consider the likelihood.

- Frequentits have an objective view of probability. For Bayesians it is a subjective best guess.

- Frequentists: data random, parameters fixed. Bayesians: data fixed, parameters random.

## Why do we want BDA in the first place?

- Elegant and intuitive paradigm.

- Incorparation of previous knowledge and allowing for updating.

- Describe complex relationships without huge amounts of data.

# Probability

## Considered known

- sample space $\Omega$.

- probability functions.

- discrete and continuous random variables.

- expected value and variance of random variables.

- from probability distribution to likelihood.

## Probability of multiple events

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggmm(rr, surface, winner_name)
```

## Joints, marginals and conditionals

(We assume the probabilities here as given, not as estimated.)

The joint is the probability two events coincide. $P(A = a \cap B = b)$ or for brevity $P(A \cap B)$

```{r, echo=FALSE}
joint <- rr %>% select(winner_name, surface) %>%
  table %>% prop.table() %>% round(3) %>% as.data.frame() %>% 
  spread(surface, Freq)
  
knitr::kable(joint)
```

## Joints, marginals and conditionals

The marginals are the univariate distributions of A and B. Sum over the other (or integrate them out when continuous).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(joint[2:4] %>% colSums())
players <- joint[2:4] %>% rowSums()
names(players) <- c("Federer", "Nadal")
knitr::kable(players)
```

## Joints, marginals and conditionals

Conditionals, like $P(A|B)$, redefine $\Omega$, it is now a subset of the joint. $P(A|B) = P(A \cap B) / P(B)$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggmm(rr, surface, winner_name, surface == "Clay")
```

## Joints, marginals and conditionals

For $P(B|A)$ this looks 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggmm(rr, surface, winner_name, player == "Nadal")
```

## Joints, marginals and conditionals

With a continuous and discrete variable, a way to graph the data is

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
player_ace <- function(df, name) {
  df %>% 
    mutate(ace    = case_when(winner_name == name ~ w_ace %>% as.integer(), 
                              loser_name  == name ~ l_ace %>% as.integer(),
                              TRUE ~ NA_integer_),
           player = name) %>% 
    select(player, ace) %>% 
    filter(!is.na(ace))
}

aces_set <- c("Nadal", "Federer", "Djokovic", "Isner", "Karlovic") %>% 
  map_df(player_ace, df = ace_set) %>%
  mutate(ace = as.integer(ace))

joint_aces <- ggplot(aces_set, aes(ace)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = player), binwidth = 1, col = "black") +
  xlim(c(-1, 45)) +
  ggtitle("Aces per match, for five players")

joint_aces
```
## Marginal for players

What does the marginal for the players look like?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(aces_set, aes(player)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = player)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

## Conditionals

$P(ace|player)$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(aces_set, aes(ace, player)) +
  ggridges::geom_density_ridges(aes(fill = player)) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  xlim(c(-1, 45))
```

## Conditionals

$P(player|ace > 15)$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
joint_aces +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 15, col = "red")
```

## Conditionals

```{r}
aces_set %>% 
  filter(ace > 15) %>% 
  count(player) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(player, prop)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = player), stat = "identity") +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

## Two continuous variables

```{r, echo = FALSE}
atp_2016 <- atp_matches %>% 
  filter(tourney_date %>% between(20160000, 20170000))

aces_height <- bind_rows(
  atp_2016 %>% select(name = winner_name, height = winner_ht, ace = w_ace),
  atp_2016 %>% select(name = loser_name, height = loser_ht, ace = l_ace)
) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(height)) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  filter(n() > 9) %>% 
  summarise(height   = max(height),
            mean_aces = mean(ace %>% as.numeric, na.rm = TRUE))
  
cont_plot <- ggplot(aces_height, aes(height, mean_aces)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  expand_limits(y = 0)
cont_plot
```

## Two continuous variables

The marginals are the univariate densities. With discrete variables we could sum over B to get marginal A. With continuous variables we need to integrate the other out.

$P(A) = \int P(A,B)db$

Also here we normalize by the marginal to get the conditional.

$P(A|B) = P(A,B) / P(B)$

## Two continuous variables
$P(a > 10 | h > 190)$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
xr <- ggplot_build(cont_plot)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$x.range[2]
yr <- ggplot_build(cont_plot)$layout$panel_ranges[[1]]$y.range[2]
cont_plot +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 190.5, xmax = xr, ymin = 10, 
           ymax = yr, fill = "cornflowerblue", alpha = .7) +
    annotate("rect", xmin = 190.5, xmax = xr, ymin = 0, 
           ymax = yr, fill = "cornflowerblue", alpha = .5)
```

## Bayes' Rule

We all learned it in Introduction to Stats.

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$

follows from combining

$P(A,B) = P(B|A) P(A)$

and 

$P(A|B) = P(A,B) / P(B)$

## Bayes' Rule

Intuition:

- take the known conditional
- convert it to the joint by multiplying by the marginal
- obtain the desired conditional by dividing by the other marginal

## Bayes' Rule

Example: Probability Federer wins the next match on Clay. 

We only know: proportion Federer wins(.343), proportion of Federer wins were on Clay (.167),
and proportion of matches played on clay (.429).

## Bayes' Rule

Going from the conditional to the joint:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggmm(rr, surface, winner_name, winner_name == "Federer")
```

## Bayes' Rule

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggmm(rr, surface, winner_name, surface == "Clay" & winner_name == "Federer")
```

## Bayes' Rule

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggmm(rr, surface, winner_name, surface == "Clay")
```

## Bayes' Rule

We can rewrite the marginal in the denominator for a discrete case as:

$$P(A=a|B) = \frac{P(B|A=a) P(A =a)}{\Sigma_i P(B|A =a_i)P(A = a_i)}$$ 

And for a continuous case this is:

$$P(A=a|B) = \frac{P(B|A=a) P(A =a)}{\int P(B|A)p(A)da}$$

## Bayesian Analysis

Remember we put a prior distribution on a parameter. 

We then use the data to obtain the likelihood.

We multiply the two into to obtain the posterior.

$$P(\theta|D) \propto P(D|\theta) P(\theta)$$
Proprotional because AUC is not equal to 1.

## Bayesian Analysis

Now following Bayes' Rule, to normalize to a probability distribution we have divide by the likelihood.

$$P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(D|\theta) P(\theta)}{P(D)}$$

Which we can rewrite as:

$$P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(D|\theta) P(\theta)}{\int P(D|\theta)P(\theta)d\theta}$$

Note that in $P(\theta|D)$ and in the numerator we refer to a specific value of $\theta$. In the demoninator it is a function of \theta (remember summing over all the values of $B$).

## Conjugate prior

We want to test if one player is better than the other. We can do this by estimating the bernoulli probability of player A beating player B.

Bernoulli density: $p(X=1) = \theta^x(1-\theta)^{(1-x)}$

makes the Bernoulli likelihood: $p(X=1) = \theta^z(1-\theta)^{(n-z)}$

where $z = \Sigma x=1$ and $n$ is number of observations.

## Conjugate prior

What prior to set on this probability?

$\theta$ must be $[0,1]$, so distribution must be limited.

The beta distribution: $p(X=x)=\frac{x^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1}}{B(\alpha, \beta)}$

We are placing this distribution on $\theta$, so $x = \theta$ in the above.

## Conjugate prior

The denominator is just a normalizing constant, does not depend on $\theta$

Thus:

$$ P(\theta) \propto \theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}$$
and

$$ P(\theta|D) \propto \theta^z(1-\theta)^{n-z} \theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}
               \propto \theta^{z+\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{n-z+\beta-1}$$

Note that this is again the denominator of a Beta, we use the same parameters to normalize.

The posterior is thus $Beta(z+\alpha-1, n-z+\beta-1)$.

In conjugacy the prior has the same functional form as the likelihood, and can be updated without solving the integral.

## Conjugate prior

$\theta = P(Federer)$, no a priori idea. Set an uninformative prior, $Beta(1, 1)$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
theta <- seq(0,1,.001)
prior_data <- data.frame(theta = theta, 
                         prior = dbeta(theta, 1, 1),
                         posterior = dbeta(theta, 12, 23))
ggplot(prior_data, aes(theta, prior)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("") +
  labs(title = "Uninformative prior",
       subtitle = "alpha = 1, beta = 1")
```

## Conjugate prior

Federer won 12 out of 35 matches. So posterior is $Beta(12, 23)$.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
posterior_plot <- 
  ggplot(prior_data, aes(theta, posterior)) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("") +
  labs(title = "Posterior",
       subtitle = "alpha = 12, beta = 23")
```

## HDI 

95% highest posterior density interval.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x_range <- qbeta(c(.025, .975), 12, 23)
posterior_plot +
    annotate("rect", xmin = x_range[1], xmax = x_range[2], ymin = 0, 
           ymax = .3, fill = "firebrick", alpha = .7)
```

$\theta = 0.5$ is just in this interval.

## The challenge of Bayesian estimation

Conjugacy makes it very easy to obtain posterior. However, only works for very simple situation.

Usually models involve many $\theta$'s. 

Integral in denominator cannot be solved.

Made Bayesian statistics a solely theoretical exercise for decades.

## Normalizing by sampling

We can no longer normalize by the marginal, because of too complex integrals.

Draws from a function proportional to a distribution are the same as draws from the actual distribution.

1. Draw many samples from the proportional distribution.

2. Calculate summary statistics, these descrice the posterior.

## Acceptance-Rejection sampling

For a function $f(x)$

1. Determine the x-range.

2. Draw $p$ samples from the x-range.

3. Draw $p$ samples from $U(0, max(f(x)))$.

4. Compare 2. and 3. on index. If 2. >= 3. accept, else reject.

## Acceptance-Rejection sampling

```{r, echo=FALSE}
half_beta <- function(x) dbeta(x, 4, 4) * .5

beta_max <- half_beta(0.5)
acc_rej_data <-data_frame(theta = runif(10^4, 0, 1),
                          unif  = runif(10^4, 0, beta_max)) %>% 
  mutate(accepted = as.numeric(half_beta(theta) > unif) %>% as.character)
ggplot(acc_rej_data, aes(theta, unif, col = accepted)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Acceptance-Rejection sampling

```{r}
stats <- acc_rej_data %>% 
  filter(accepted == '1') %>% 
  summarise(mn = mean(theta), 
            sd = sd(theta))

est_beta <- function(mu, sd) {
  var   <- sd^2
  alpha <- ((1 - mu) / var - 1 / mu) * mu ^ 2
  beta  <- alpha * (1 / mu - 1)
  c(alpha = alpha, beta = beta)
}

est_beta(stats$mn, stats$sd) %>% round(3)
```
